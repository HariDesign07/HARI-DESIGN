# First Screening Test - Hariharan

## Overview
This project is part of a design screening assignment where I was asked to recreate three provided web sections and adapt them into mobile-responsive layouts. I have completed the designs using Figma.

## Tools Used
- **Figma** â€“ for UI design and layout
- **Google Fonts (Manrope)** â€“ for typography
- **Custom-designed icons** â€“ I created all icons used in the design to match the original style

## Design Process
- I followed a **tracing method** by placing the reference images inside Figma and accurately rebuilding the layout using clean layers, consistent spacing, and matching typography.
- Designed both **desktop (1920x1080)** and **mobile (375x812)** versions of each section.
- Ensured responsive structure, mobile readability, and visual clarity.
- All icons were **individually created** to closely reflect the style and function of the originals.
- Added minimal **process-related placeholder text** to maintain layout integrity.
